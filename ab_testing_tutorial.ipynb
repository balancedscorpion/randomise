    "This notebook demonstrates the key requirements for production-grade A/B testing randomisation and a sample implementation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why do we want randomisation?\n",
    "\n",
    "In large scale digital organisations, A/B is often considered the gold standard for making decisions about Product features and changes. A core assumption of A/B testing is that each user's outcome is independent from everyone else's, and drawn from the same distribution. In order to best ensure this is the case, users are randomised. It is important that they are randomised properly so that the measurements can be made correctly and p-values work properly. [Berger 2021](https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-021-01303-z) provides an excellent breakdown of different randomisation approaches for Randomised Control Trials. The below notebook will run through how randomisation can be implemented effectively for digital online testing. "

    "### Why not just implement an \"every other group\" approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "For most cases, this could usually work fine. However, it's not optimal, and in some cases could result in poor quality decisions. Below are a few of the reasons why such an approach is not effective:\n",
    "* *Time patterns:* If users arrive in waves (e.g. mobile-heavy evenings, desktop-heavy work hours), alternating allocation can systematically put certain times of day (and their behaviors) more into one group than the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Sorted queues:* If your system processes users in some order (by geography, campaign, device, VIP status, etc.), then “every other” means those attributes are unevenly split too.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Batch / technical effects:* Sharding, server assignment, caching, bot filtering, or internal traffic often follow regular patterns; a deterministic rule can line up with those patterns and give one variant more “weird” traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "So to ensure external systems can still implement the above (if it is important for such a system to do so), and the A/B test results can still be valid, it is preferable to implement a more robust form of allocation - *Randomisation*."

    "## Requirements for A/B Testing Randomisation\n",
    "\n",
    "A robust A/B testing randomiser must satisfy three critical properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Deterministic and Replicable** \n",
    "- The same user ID must **always** be assigned to the same bucket for a given experiment\n",
    "- This must hold true across:\n",
    "  - Multiple API calls\n",
    "  - Different servers (sharded deployments)\n",
    "  - Different environments (dev, staging, production)\n",
    "  - Service restarts\n",
    "- **Why it matters**: Users must have a consistent experience. If a user sees variant A on Monday and variant B on Tuesday, it breaks the experiment and creates a poor user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Uniform and Unbiased (i.i.d)** \n",
    "- Users must be distributed uniformly across buckets according to specified weights\n",
    "- Each user assignment should be independent and identically distributed\n",
    "- No correlation between user IDs and bucket assignments\n",
    "- **Why it matters**: Statistical validity of A/B tests depends on proper randomisation. Biased assignment invalidates statistical tests and leads to incorrect conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Lightning Fast** ⚡\n",
    "- Bucket assignment must be extremely fast (microseconds, not milliseconds)\n",
    "- Minimal CPU overhead\n",
    "- **Why it matters**: Randomisation happens on the hot path of every user request. Slow randomisation increases latency and reduces throughput.\n",

    "Our design aims to ensure that the same user will always be assigned to the same bucket, regardless of where the randomisation is hosted, how many times a call is made, in which order or anything else. The same user, for the same experiment should always yield the same bucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to this, is to use hashing algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hashing algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, a hash function takes some input (like \"experiment_42:alice@example.com\") and deterministically turns it into a big integer. For the same input, you always get the same integer; for slightly different inputs, you get completely different integers that look random.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared with approaches like `numpy.random.choice()` or other randomisation functions, hashing algorithms bring the following benefits:\n",
    "* No dependence on RNG state: the result depends only on (user, experiment), not on how many calls have happened before.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Order doesn’t matter: process users in any order, in any service, and they get the same bucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Repeats are consistent: the same user in the same experiment always maps to the same bucket, even across machines, languages, or days, as long as the hash function and mapping rule are the same.\n",

    "A first idea might be to use a Data Scientist's favourite library, numpy and the `numpy.random.choice()` function to assign users to buckets.\n",
    "The problem with this, is that while it is deterministic if a seed is set, it is not consistent for the same user, as the randomization is managed using an internal state, and each call subsequent call to the system changes the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate this, we can look at two examples:\n",
    "1. Making the same call repeatedly for the same \"user\"\n",

    "## Summary and Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ What We've Proven:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Deterministic and Replicable** ✓\n",
    "   - Same user + seed → same bucket (always)\n",
    "   - Works across all environments and platforms\n",
    "   - No dependency on random number generators\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Uniform and Unbiased (i.i.d)** ✓\n",
    "   - Users distributed according to specified weights\n",
    "   - No correlation between user IDs and assignments\n",
    "   - Statistical validity maintained\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Lightning Fast** ✓\n",
    "   - XXH3: ~1-10μs per assignment (hundreds of thousands ops/sec)\n",
    "   - Much faster than cryptographic hashes (MD5, SHA256)\n",
    "   - Suitable for high-traffic production environments\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Recommended Configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from app.utils import randomise\n",
    "\n",
    "# For production A/B testing, use defaults (optimized):\n",
    "bucket = randomise(\n",
    "    userid=\"user_12345\",\n",
    "    seed=\"my-experiment\",\n",
    "    weights=[0.5, 0.5]\n",
    ")\n",
    "# Uses: XXH3 hash + MAD distribution + 10,000 table size\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Don't Use:\n",
    "- `numpy.random.choice()` - not deterministic across environments\n",
    "- `random.random()` - not deterministic\n",
    "- MD5/SHA256 for high-traffic endpoints (too slow)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Why This Implementation Wins:\n",
    "1. **Deterministic hashing** ensures consistency\n",
    "2. **XXH3** provides best speed/quality tradeoff\n",
    "3. **MAD distribution** reduces modulo bias\n",
    "4. **Large table size** (10,000) ensures high precision\n",
    "5. **Production-ready** with proper error handling\n",
    "\n",
